# Libriflow

Libriflow is a responsive web application designed to help users manage their personal book library. With Libriflow, you can add books and authors, track reading progress, and store notes or memorable quotes from each book. Built with a modern technology stack, this project is ideal for showcasing my skills in full-stack development.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
